# NYCDA WD JavaScript Challenges #1
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 5 Lecture 2. This project was a couple of JavaScript katas.

### Assignment:
1. Log to the console the value of x * 9 for each number between 0 and 100. The console output should look like this:
  ```
  0 * 9 = 0
  1 * 9 = 9
  2 * 9 = 18
  3 * 9 = 27
  4 * 9 = 36
  5 * 9 = 45
  6 * 9 = 54
  7 * 9 = 63
  8 * 9 = 72
  9 * 9 = 81

  ...
  ```

2. Assume we have a class with Lucille, Michael and George Michael. For each name, log to the console ```name is in the class```. The console should look like this:
  ```
  Lucille is in the class
  Michael is in the class
  George Michael is in the class
  ```
